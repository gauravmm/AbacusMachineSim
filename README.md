## Language
The `abacusmachine` language is desgined to be a simple and effective language for specifying abacus machines. It comes with built-in testing and scope features to make it easier to build complex functions and verify code correctness.

### Control Flow

Control flow proceeds sequentially forwards unless changed by a `goto` or branching within a register command. Jump anchors are specified at the start of a line with a leading `:`. All names must begin with a letter and can include letters, numbers, and `_`. Examples are:
```
	:anchor_name
	:this123 /* code continues on this line */
```

Within register commands, either `next` or `~` can be used to refer to the next line instead of an anchor. You cannot place an anchor on the same line as a `goto`.


### Registers

As with any abacus machine, an unlimited number of registers storing natural numbers are available. Registers are always specified by square brackets, and may be defined numerically (`[1]`, `[5]`, etc.) or by name (`[ret_val]`, `[arg1]`, etc.). Registers contain the value 0 by default.

Two operations can be performed on registers, addition and subtraction. They are written as:
```
  
  [7]+; // Increment register 1 and continue.
  [7]-; // Decrement register 1 and continue.
  [7]+, next;      // Increment and go to the next line.
  [7]-, :start, ~; // Decrement, and if the register is
                   //  still positive go to :start. If
                   //  zero, go to the next line.
```


### Functions

All executable code is organized into functions, each with its own scope. The functions are written as:
```
function rem([1],[arg2]) -> [rv1], [7] {
   /* code omitted */
} where {
  rem(5,7) is rem(12,7);
  rem(10,6) is 4;
}
```

Where `rem` is the function name, the function arguments are given as a comma-separated list of registers. The registers containing the return value are specified after the `->`. At the end of the function whatever the value stored in the return registers is passed to the calling function.

Function calls are made as follows: `quo([1], [2]) -> [6], [8];`. Registers in the parenthesis are passed by value to the function, and the return values are copied to the source registers, overwriting whatever previous values were stored.

### Recursion

In actual abacus machines the function abstraction does not exist, and functions are implemented by "copying" the structure of the abacus machine into each place the function is invoked. To ensure that this language does not (accidentally) allow for an abacus machine with infinite states to be implemented, recursive calls (including mutual recursion) are not allowed.
